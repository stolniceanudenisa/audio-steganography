# Audio Steganography

## Description
* __Audio Steganography__: The technique to embed text into audio file without loss of audio quality, and while extraction can get the embedded text back.
* This is a simple system created to apply Audio Steganography (only supports ```.wav``` files for now)
* It uses 2 main algorithms:
    * Least Significant Bit
    * Phase Coding

## Visuals
* Main screen:

![Main screen](./images/main.png?raw=true "Main screen")

* Encode screen:

![Main screen](./images/encode.png?raw=true "Main screen")

* Decode screen:

![Main screen](./images/decode.png?raw=true "Main screen")

## Installation

``` 
git clone https://github.com/duongdanghung20/audio-steganography-system 
```
